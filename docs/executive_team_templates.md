## Implementation Notes

To implement this template system:

1. Create a configuration file (JSON/YAML) defining executive templates
2. Implement a template loader in the platform
3. Create a UI for selecting and customizing templates
4. Allow for saving custom executive configurations

### Example Template Configuration (JSON)

```json
{
  "executive_templates": {
    "visionary_strategist": {
      "base_role": "Chief Strategy Officer",

        "strategic_planning": "EXPERT",
        "competitive_analysis": "EXPERT",
        "market_positioning": "EXPERT",
        "business_model_innovation": "EXPERT",
        "emerging_trends": "ADVANCED"
      },
      "attributes": {
        "decision_style": "Intuitive",
        "risk_tolerance": "High",
        "time_orientation": "Long-term",

      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Future Extensions

This template system could be extended to include:

1. **Dynamic trait combinations**: Algorithm-generated executive profiles
2. **Learning from decisions**: Executives that adapt based on decision history
3. **Industry-specific templates**: Pre-configured executives for specific industries
4. **Team composition recommendations**: Suggested executive teams for different decision types
5. **Interface-based configuration**: UI for building custom executive teams
