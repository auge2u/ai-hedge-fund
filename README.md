# Enterprise Agentic AI Executive Platform

A sophisticated decision intelligence system that simulates a high-performance executive team through specialized AI agents, working collaboratively to analyze complex business decisions using formal frameworks and robust consensus mechanisms.

## Overview

The Enterprise Agentic AI Executive Platform creates an AI-powered executive team that collaborates to provide comprehensive strategic decision support. Each AI executive brings domain-specific expertise (strategy, finance, risk, legal, ethics, technology) and works within formal decision frameworks to produce well-reasoned, explainable recommendations.

### Key Capabilities

- **Multi-Domain Expertise**: Specialized AI executives with distinct domains of expertise
- **Framework-Driven Analysis**: Formal decision frameworks for structured reasoning
- **Consensus Building**: Sophisticated mechanisms to find agreement and resolve conflicts
- **Explainable Decisions**: Complete traceability from initial query to final recommendation
- **Governance Integration**: Built-in compliance, ethics, and risk management

### Use Cases

- Strategic market entry and expansion decisions
- Major investment and capital allocation decisions
- Product development and innovation strategy
- Risk assessment and mitigation planning
- Partnership and acquisition evaluation
- Technology adoption and digital transformation

## Architecture

The platform implements a modular, component-based architecture designed for flexibility and extensibility:

## Example Usage

```python
from src.executive_agents.strategy_executive import StrategyExecutive
from src.executive_agents.risk_executive import RiskExecutive
from src.decision_frameworks.bayesian_framework import BayesianDecisionFramework
from src.consensus.consensus_builder import ConsensusBuilder
from src.executive_team_orchestrator import ExecutiveTeamOrchestrator

# Set up the executive team
strategy_exec = StrategyExecutive()
risk_exec = RiskExecutive()
bayesian_framework = BayesianDecisionFramework()
consensus_builder = ConsensusBuilder()

# Create orchestrator and register components
orchestrator = ExecutiveTeamOrchestrator()
orchestrator.register_executive("strategy", strategy_exec)
orchestrator.register_executive("risk", risk_exec)
orchestrator.register_framework("bayesian", bayesian_framework)
orchestrator.set_consensus_builder(consensus_builder)

# Create a decision request
decision_request = {
    "decision_id": "d-2023-10-15-001",
    "query": "Should we expand our product line into the European market?",
    "context": {
        "background_information": {
            "company_description": "Mid-sized technology company specializing in AI-powered analytics",

            "available_capital": "$10M for expansion initiatives",
            # Additional context...
        },
        "alternatives": [
            {"id": "full_expansion", "name": "Full Market Entry", "description": "..."},

            {"id": "partnership", "name": "Strategic Partnership", "description": "..."},
            {"id": "no_expansion", "name": "Delay Expansion", "description": "..."}
        ],
        "constraints": [
            "Expansion budget limited to $10M",
            "Must comply with EU regulations (GDPR, AI Act)",
            # Additional constraints...
        ],
        "organizational_priorities": {
            "growth": "High priority",
            "profitability": "Medium priority",
            # Additional priorities...
        }
    },
    "required_domains": ["strategic", "financial", "risk", "market"],
    "urgency": 3,  # 1-5 scale
    "importance": 4,  # 1-5 scale
    "complexity_level": "complicated"  # simple, complicated, complex, chaotic
}

# Make the decision
decision_outcome = await orchestrator.make_decision(decision_request)

# Access the recommendation
print(f"Recommendation: {decision_outcome['recommendation'].title}")
print(f"Summary: {decision_outcome['recommendation'].summary}")
print(f"Confidence: {decision_outcome['recommendation'].confidence}")
print(f"Consensus Level: {decision_outcome['consensus'].consensus_level}")
```
